# CSV Anonymizer
## _Hide your sensitive data!_

This script reads data from a CSV file and generates another anonymized CSV as output.

Let's say you have a CSV containing sensitive data about your users, and you want to work with that file but you don't want to identify them with their names, IDs, bank account, whatever... This script picks up the fields you want to anonymize and applies a digest bashed on the SHA-256 cypher algorithm.

I have uploaded a sample CSV. If you work with another kind of data, you will have to adapt it to your own circumstances. This is just an example.

The aim of this was introducing anonymized data on pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms without affecting the results.
