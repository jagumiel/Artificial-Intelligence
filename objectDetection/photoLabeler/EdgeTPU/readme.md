# Edge TPU
## _Python Scripts to run on a Google Coral Embedded System_


The Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a specific hardware designed to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. This folder on the repository will contain the models to run inferences on the Google Coral Device, using its TPU.


The aim of this is to develop some algorithms for object detection to run on Coral. In order to do so, you can get some precompiled models or get some trained models and convert them to run on TFLite quantized. Note: Edge TPU works only with UINT8 input tensors, so a quantization process is needed.

This is under development, so stay tuned and come back for more updates.
